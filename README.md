# MVisAGe

DNA copy number changes (gains and losses) are commonly seen in tumor tissue.  Although
these events occur randomly throughout the genome, some provide a selective growth 
advantage because they lead to increased (gains) or decreased (losses) expressed of 
affected genes.  MVisAGe was designed to help users explore the effects of copy number
changes and alterations in DNA methylation status on gene expression.  Gene-level Pearson
correlation coefficients are computed and plotted according to the genomic position of
the underlying genes.
